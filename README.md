# EGC182_Food Website Project

## Background
Many food stalls around Singapore are going digital by putting the stall information on a website to
improve the stall awareness and thus, attract more business. 

## Project Objectives:
- To develop an online website for a food stall that we like or patronise most (e.g., a hawker center, a coffee shop, food court or any eatery.)
- The website should provide relevant information to customers, allows customers to buy online and contact the stall.
- The website should be developed from scratch and to include at least 5 pages which can be viewed on a desktop.
