# EGC182_Internet-and-Web-Development-Project

## Background
Many food stalls around Singapore are going digital by putting the stall information on a website to
improve the stall awareness and thus, attract more business. The website should provide relevant
information to customers, allows customers to buy online and contact the stall.

## Project Objectives:
This project requires students to develop an online website for a food stall that they like or patronise
most. The stall can be from a hawker center, a coffee shop, food court or any eatery. The project
should be developed from scratch and to include at least 5 pages which can be viewed on a
desktop.
